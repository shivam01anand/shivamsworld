# Digging Deeper

This is the second post. We can add more content here, including code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

And another image, maybe without a cover image specified in the front matter:

<MarkdownImage 
  src="/images/sample-image2.jpg" 
  alt="Another placeholder image for the second post" 
  caption="Captions are optional but highly recommended for accessibility and context."
/>

That's all for now!
