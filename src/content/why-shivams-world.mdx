The domain was cheap, but it was a choice nonetheless.

And a truth. Not the one followed by an evil laugh, but about the nature of interpreted and experienced reality. 

Perhaps an obvious reminder to the reader yet for the writer, it's a guiding light, to keep it personal, raw.

This is my nth attempt to blog, here's hoping it's the last yet continued one. Like a glacier, finally emitting, forever. Untilâ€¦ you're not there when it ends.
