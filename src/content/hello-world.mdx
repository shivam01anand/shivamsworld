# Hello, Classy Blog!

Welcome to my new blog. I built this using Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, and MDX. It's designed to be clean, modern, and easy to manage.

This is a paragraph of text. You can write standard Markdown here.

## Subheading

Here's an example of an image embedded using the `MarkdownImage` component:

<MarkdownImage 
  src="/images/sample-image1.jpg" 
  alt="A placeholder image for the first post" 
  caption="This is a sample image with a nice caption below it. Notice the styling!" 
/>

Stay tuned for more posts!
