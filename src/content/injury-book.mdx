I know this'll be a successs if no duplicates have to show up, if fewer posts are painfully jotted down. 

Let's start with last week's ridiculous 

Chapter 1, or season 1? Lesson 1. This book doesn't want to have many chapters. 

# What happened? (symptom) How bad?
A shooting zipping pain from front of elbows to wrist.
Graduated to mind occupying after 10 days, and flared up after a lower body exercise - running. 

# When did you notice?
2-3 days after the back/chest days.

# How did you identify? RCA
Time to diagnose - 7-10 days, a fortunate consult with physio at home. Pressing deep on the tendons hurts and confirms the issue. 
But there's another issue - fucked delts. Or fucked rotator cuffs? Circling the shoulder hurts.

# What was fucked?
**Major muscle** - Arms, Shoulders
**Specific part** - left hand's elbow, shoulders/delts.

# Why did this issue occur? 
Pushing hard beyond limits even when form was compromised > tendons etc are recruited.

# What was weak?
Rotator cuffs - I did see plenty of reveals about this muscle being the missing key in shoulder issues. But I ignored it.
Forearms (& other muscles in arms), which left force on tendons. Tendons worked, but they weren't supposed to.
The larger issue being Ignoring support/stabilising muscles.
